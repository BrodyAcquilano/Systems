3.8 Long-Term Outcomes: More equitable service distribution  
**Notes:** GIS maps of service deserts, municipal fragmentation  

### Chapter 4: Landscape Heterogeneity and Uneven Terrain  
4.1 Definition/Introduction: Uneven landscapes create fragmentation in access, opportunity, and exposure to risk.  
4.2 Vocabulary: Heterogeneity, fragmentation, edge effects, zoning, terrain cost  
4.3 Analogies: Topographic relief, watershed divides, patchy ecosystems, war zones  
4.4 Case Studies: Zoning exclusions, uphill access to healthcare, "wrong side of the tracks" schools  
4.5 Analysis: Legal, physical, and policy landscapes produce uneven service terrains  
4.6 Potential Solutions: Legal harmonization, transit-oriented planning, equity-based zoning  
4.7 Solution Analysis: Risk of gentrification, political resistance, inter-jurisdictional complexity  
4.8 Long-Term Outcomes: Smoother terrain → more universal access, less geographic precarity  
**Notes:**  
- Could integrate GIS terrain modeling and urban topology  
- Discuss “terrain friction” in access: stairs, ID requirements, local ordinances  
- Connect to military and disaster relief models for access under constraints  


### Chapter 5: Resource Flows and Scarcity Cycles  
4.1 Definition/Introduction: Inputs, outputs, and resource flow  
4.2 Vocabulary: Bottleneck, leak, redundancy, buffer, debt trap  
4.3 Analogies: Hydraulic systems, nutrient cycles, blackout cascades  
4.4 Case Studies: Overdrafts, missed work, food insecurity  
4.5 Analysis: Blocked flows = vulnerability; access = stability  
4.6 Potential Solutions: Basic income, emergency buffer programs  
4.7 Solution Analysis: Risks of inflation vs. downstream savings  
4.8 Long-Term Outcomes: Break scarcity cycles → lower systemic cost  
**Notes:** Include feedback from behavioral econ and time poverty studies

## Part III – Engineering for Stability and Resilience  
*Engineering and systems design applied to social problems*

### Chapter 6: Feedback Loops and Instability  
5.1 Definition/Introduction: Feedback in systems  
5.2 Vocabulary: Positive feedback, negative feedback, stability  
5.3 Analogies: Thermostats, runaway loops, climate systems  
5.4 Case Studies: "Three Strikes", benefit cutoff traps  
5.5 Analysis: Where policy amplifies vs. dampens outcomes  
5.6 Potential Solutions: Conditional programs with feedback checks  
5.7 Solution Analysis: Balancing incentives with reliability  
5.8 Long-Term Outcomes: Fewer cycles of crisis  
**Notes:** Could include addiction → arrest → housing loop  

### Chapter 7: Load, Stress, and Failure Thresholds  
6.1 Definition/Introduction: Structural load and human pressure  
6.2 Vocabulary: Fatigue, yield point, safety factor  
6.3 Analogies: Bridge collapse, mental burnout, system fatigue  
6.4 Case Studies: ER overuse, eviction cycles, school dropout  
6.5 Analysis: Poor have lower safety margins, higher failure risk  
6.6 Potential Solutions: Legal rest periods, overload caps  
6.7 Solution Analysis: System capacity cost vs. social stability  
6.8 Long-Term Outcomes: Better margin → fewer crises → lower cost  
**Notes:** Add OSHA or fire code analogies for system thresholds  

### Chapter 8: Interfaces, Coupling, and Interdependency  
7.1 Definition/Introduction: System boundaries and overlap  
7.2 Vocabulary: Interface, tight coupling, modularity  
7.3 Analogies: Software APIs, valve systems, ecological edge effects  
7.4 Case Studies: Shelter ↔ Policing, Court ↔ Employment  
7.5 Analysis: Policy hand-offs that fail due to weak coupling  
7.6 Potential Solutions: Interagency portals, shared intake systems  
7.7 Solution Analysis: Costs of integration vs. fragmentation losses  
7.8 Long-Term Outcomes: More adaptable, humane service network  
**Notes:** Include examples of broken handoff loops or system ping-pong
